This is a Projects assigned for the Machine Learning lesson, for the Master in Artificial Intelligence, in the department of Computer Science of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

The project was to create a model that could recognize images of Rock Paper & Scissors and play the winning hand according to the known game.

Dataset downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors

You might need to change folder or directory names.

After training different ANNs and CNN I picked the one with the highest accuracy with 99.5% . The results of my models are shown in the CSV files.

The first step is reading the data and creating the dataset.

Steps 2 and 3 are for the ANNs PCA and Model Training so to pick the best accuracy one

Step 4 is training a CNN, from the original data.

After that you can find the best accuracy algorithm and apply it to the game

Step 4 is the actual game, when an agent picks an image, adds noise to it, and our model is trying to predict the image so it can win the game.
